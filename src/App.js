            <p>After graduating from Ohio University with a bachelors degree in Visual Communication, I‚Äôve spent my 10 year career in Austin, Texas working for a handful of tech companies. Through the time I‚Äôve spent at each company, I‚Äôve encountered a variety of technologies, methodologies and colleagues who have helped educate and shape me into the developer I am today.</p>
            <p>My main interest is in the front end, the visual part of any app, as I gravitate more towards what I can see and interact with in my day to day life. Seeing an app or website come to life as I code motivates me and I feed off of the enjoyment the products I develop bring to end users. I strongly believe in clean, tightly written, documented and tested code. I also believe in the ecosystem in which a product is developed; the project and product managers, designers and QA engineers as well as the developers are integral in the success of any product.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy modernizing code bases and refactoring for performance improvements. It is immensely satisfying to untangle old code and put it back together in a consistent, readable way with a lower learning curve for developers, in a more efficient development environment. At every job I've worked at, I've encountered long ignored code bases, still actively developed in, that slow developers to a crawl and invite slow code and sometimes security issues to run rampant. Its why I consistently stress to colleagues that an up to date codebase is an efficient codebase and often times a more performant codebase.</p>
